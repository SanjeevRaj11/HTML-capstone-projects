# HTML-capstone-projects

This description provides an in-depth overview of the structure and components of this HTML capstone-project,
which is a tribute Single-page-Website dedicated to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, and was created on '15-OCT-2023' with respect to his Birthday.

It consists of a single HTML file (index.html) and the directory containing images used in the website. 
Let's break down the technical aspects of the project:

1. The project starts with the HTML5 document type declaration to indicate that it follows HTML5 standards.

2. This project developed using basic HTML tags like h1, div, p, etc. only which I have learned so far. 

3. The project made with help of both inline and internal CSS styles to define the visual appearance    of various elements within the website. The styling properties include:   
   Basic color properties, Text properties, Image Styling properties, Link Styling properties, Line Spacing, etc.
 
4. Basic CSS style properties are used:
   These styles are applied to elements throughout the website, which includes headings, navigation, images, and paragraphs.

5.The <body> tag contains the main content of the website,
  It is divided into six primary sections: Introduction, Birth, Contribution to Education, Family, Inspiration, and Conclusion.

6.The project includes a directory containing images used throughout the website. Images are sourced locally and
  linked to the HTML using the src attribute in the <img> tags. Images add visual context and depth to the content.
