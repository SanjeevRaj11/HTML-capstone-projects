            <u>Capacities to be built among students:</u><br>The primary focus of the students should be to excel in their studies. This is their first contribution to the development of the nation. The education system should instill in the minds of students capacities of inquiry, creativity, technology, entrepreneurial and moral leadership. If we develop in all our students these five capacities, we will produce "Autonomous Learner" a self-directed, self controlled, lifelong learner, who will have the capacity to both respect authority and at the same time is capable of questioning authority, in an appropriate manner.

    <p>

        for a better life. His father, Jainulabiddin Marakayar, and mother, Ashiamma<br> Jainulabiddin, instilled in him the values of honesty, hard work, and love for the country. 
        <br>
        His parents, Jainulabiddin Marakayar and Ashiamma Jainulabiddin, played pivotal roles in<br> shaping his character and instilling in him a strong sense of ethics.

    <p>
        Kalam had the humblest upbringing in the rural set-up of Rameswaram. His saintly father Jainulabiddin Marakayar and kind-hearted mother Ashiamma Jainulabiddin could not <br>afford much to the making of their aspiring son.
        <br>
        What they inculcated in his mind was love for the country and faith in the just and the truth. With that capital, Kalam fought away all worries and crisis. A top-class scientist, a wise and honest administrator, a teacher of 
        Athenian glory, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam breathed his last on 27th July 2015.
        The entire country mourned the great loss. The great teacher, the mentor of India left us forever. But the life and deeds he left for us would ever motivate us to dream and dare, to do and die for our motherland.
